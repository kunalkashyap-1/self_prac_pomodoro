        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then
          university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus
          on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked
          himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged
          by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped
          kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.
