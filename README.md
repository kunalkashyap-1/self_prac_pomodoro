# Pomodoro Timer

A Pomodoro timer is a time management tool that helps you break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This Pomodoro timer is a JavaScript implementation that uses jQuery to handle button clicks and DOM manipulation.

## Features
- Set timer length for short, normal, and long breaks
- Start, pause, and reset the timer
- Alarm sound when the timer is finished
- Option to switch between different timer lengths while the timer is running

## How to use
1. Select the desired timer length by clicking on the "Short Break", "Normal Break", or "Long Break" button. The timer will automatically update to reflect the chosen length.
2. Click on the "Start" button to begin the timer. The timer will begin counting down from the chosen length.
3. When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound will play and you will be prompted to take a break.
4. Click on the "Pause" button to pause the timer and the "Reset" button to reset the timer to its original length.
